I am a programmer, you can pay me to write code for you. **Please pay me....** *I need money.*


Here is a list of things I can do for you if you pay me money:
- write some junk, undocumented code
- run away with the money
- write a program other than what you requested because I have found a more interesting project

[Here is a link to this page, IDK why i would redirect you to this page when you are already on it.... but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do](http://tbastasch.github.io/RMarkdown/README.md)

Here is an image i stole:

Take some useless python code:
```python
money = "You give this to me"
```

The above code must be paid for if used... contact me.
